Although using your cell phone to text or make phone calls is illegal and EXTREMELY 
dangerous while driving, many people (including us) still do it. If there is really 
no way to prevent drivers from using their cell phones while driving, we decided to 
offer drivers a way to at least do it safely.

Voicial is a COMPLETELY hands-free Android application that allows users to send and 
receive text messages, as well as make and receive calls, all via voice commands. 
The following are commands currently supported by Voicial: 
	
	- "Send text to" RECIPIENT_NAME
	- "Read text from" RECIPIENT_NAME
	- "Call" RECIPIENT_NAME

Voicial is the first in its kind to offer a complete hands-free experience for both 
calling and texting. Products like Siri and Google Now are the closest tools prior 
to Voicial that allows for hands-free communication. However, Siri makes the user 
press the microphone button for every voice command whereas Google Now, who recently 
integrated the "hot-word" OK-GOOGLE to allow users to make voice commands without 
pressing any buttons, does not allow users to read their text message with voice 
commands. This makes Voicial the go-to application for hands-free communication!
